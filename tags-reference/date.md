# date

The **date** tag outputs a string according to the given _format_ parameter using the given _date_ parameter. If no _date_ provided, the current time is used.

```xml
<cms:date />
```

```xml
<cms:date k_page_date />
```

```xml
<cms:date k_page_date format='jS M, Y' />
```

## Parameters

* date
* format
* gmt
* locale
* charset

### date

The date to be formated.<br>
This parameter is expected to be in '_Y-m-d H:i:s_' format (e.g. 2010-05-30 21:35:54). All date related variables set by Couch tags, e.g. *k_page_date*, *k_page_modification_date*, *k_archive_date* etc., are in this format.

If date is omitted, current date is taken with regard to variable '_K_GMT_OFFSET_' from CouchCMS configuration file (`couch/config.php`).

### format

The **date** tag supports two different types of format characters - locale-aware and non locale-aware.<br>
With locale-aware characters, you can specify that the date is to formatted according to, for example, _french_ locale or _italian_ locale by setting the **locale** parameter.<br>
The locale-aware characters all have a % sign prefixed to them.

If parameter **format** is omitted the default is assumed i.e. `format='F d, Y'`

---

**The locale-aware and the non locale-aware characters cannot be intermixed.**

### gmt

By setting this parameter to '1', you can get the GMT equivalent of the date provided.

### locale

If you use the locale-aware format characters mentioned above, this parameter can be set to the locale desired for formatting the provided date.

```xml
<cms:date k_page_date format='%B %d, %Y' locale='french' />
```

```xml
<cms:date k_page_date format='%B %d, %Y' locale='italian' />
```

```xml
<cms:date k_page_date format='%B %d, %Y' locale='russian' charset='windows-1251'/>
```

```xml
<cms:date format='%A %T %B' locale='norwegian'/>
```

This feature depends entirely on the indicated locale being available at your web server. If the locale is not available, the default 'english' locale is used.

### charset

Some locales do not provide their output in UTF8 character set. This causes strange ?? characters to appear in the output.<br>
The **date** tag can help converting the output to UTF8 if you can provide it with information about the charset used by the locale.

For example -

```xml
<cms:date k_page_date format='%B %d, %Y' locale='greek' charset='ISO-8859-7' />
```

```xml
<cms:date k_page_date format='%B %d, %Y' locale='russian' charset='ISO-8859-5' />
```

The following is a rough list of the charset used by different languages -

#### ISO

**ISO-8859-1**<br>

**ISO-8859-5 - Cyrillic**<br>
Bulgarian, Byelorussian, Macedonian, Russian, Serbian and Ukrainian.

**ISO-8859-6 - Arabic**<br>
Non-accented Arabic.

**ISO-8859-7 - Modern Greek**<br>
Greek.

**ISO-8859-8 - Hebrew**<br>
Non-accented Hebrew.

**ISO-8859-9 - Latin 5**<br>
Same as 8859-1 except for Turkish instead of Icelandic

**ISO-8859-10 - Latin 6**<br>

## Examples

### sample formats

A few ready-to-use format examples -

```xml
<cms:date format='Y-m-d H:i:s' />      (MySQL)
<cms:date format='D, d M Y H:i:s' />   (RSS)
<cms:date format='Y-m-d\TH:i:sP' />    (Atom)
<cms:date format='l, d-M-Y H:i:s T' /> (Cookie)

<cms:date format='\i\t \i\s \t\h\e jS \d\a\y.' />
<cms:date format='D M j G:i:s T Y' />
```

### relative dates

Dates can be set as strings, relative to current day or another date e.g.

```xml
Current -365 days: <cms:date '-365 days' />
Current +1 day: <cms:date '+1 day' />
Current +1 week: <cms:date '+1 week' />
Current +1 month: <cms:date '+1 month' />
Current +1 day 4 hours 2 seconds: <cms:date '+1 day 4 hours 2 seconds' />
First day of current week: <cms:date 'Monday this week' />
Last day of previous week: <cms:date 'Sunday last week' />
Next Thursday: <cms:date 'next Thursday' />
Last Monday: <cms:date 'last Monday' />
First day of next month: <cms:date 'first day of next month' />
First day of next month: <cms:date 'first day of next month' format='l' />
Last day of march 2009: <cms:date '2009-03 last day of this month' format='l, j/n/Y' />
Christmas Day next year: <cms:date '25 december next year' format='l, j/n/Y' />
Yesterday 14:00: <cms:date 'yesterday 14:00' format='j F, Y H:i'/>
Tomorrow: <cms:date 'tomorrow' format='Y-m-d' />
Tomorrow noon: <cms:date 'tomorrow noon' format='j F, Y H:i' />
A minute before midnight: <cms:date 'midnight -1 minute' format='H:i' />
```

### date comparison

Compare dates with tag 'cms:if' & make sure the left-hand-side of the equation is a variable e.g.

```xml
<cms:set post_date="<cms:date k_page_date format='Ymd' />" />
<cms:if post_date lt "<cms:date format='Ymd' />" >
   ...
</cms:if>
```

### usage in filters

Use variables in *custom_field* as well (always use double quotes `"` with expressions) e.g.

```xml
<cms:set curr_date="<cms:date format='Y-m-d H:i:s' />" />
<cms:pages custom_field="my_date <= <cms:show curr_date />">
```

## Variables

This tag is self-closing and does not set any variables of its own.
