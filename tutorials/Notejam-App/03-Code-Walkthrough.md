# Code Walkthrough

Let us begin with a bird-eye view of how the three entities comprising Notejam (i.e. users, notes and pads) relate to each other using the following ERD (the 'crow-feet' end if the 'many' end of the relationship)-

![](./img/erd.png)

The relationships can be summarized in words as follows -

**1. notes and users**

&emsp;A user can have many notes but a note can belong to only one user

**2. pads and users**

&emsp;A user can have many pads but a pad can belong to only one user

**3. notes and pads**

&emsp;A pad can contain many notes but a note can only be within a single pad

Keep these relationships in mind as we now go through the templates and see how they are implemented.

We'll begin with the notes template.
