# Pads

OK, the good thing about the 'Pads' section is that it is almost a copy of the ['Notes'](https://github.com/trendoman/Midware/tree/main/tutorials/Notejam-App/04-Notes.md#notes) section that we've already studied in excruciating detail.

So, instead of hand-holding you through its template and view snippets, I'll encourage you to take a look at the source files yourselves. There shouldn't be a single point in there that we haven't already covered and so you should really find everything easy.

Begin from the ***pads.php*** template examining the routes defining its various views. Then move over to the `snippets/views/pads` folder to take a look at the snippets implementing those views.

I'll just jot down the few minor points that are slightly different in this section -

1. You won't find a 'list_view'. It isn't required for pads as we list all the pads in the sidebar of the 'notes' section.
2. The 'page_view' of pads, instead of showing details of a single pad, shows all the notes belonging to that pad. So it is almost identical to the 'list_view' of notes.

We'll now take a look at the final section of Notejam - Users
